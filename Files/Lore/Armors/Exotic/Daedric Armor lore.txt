Daedric Armor is... well it's something else.

What you're doing when you're smithing Daedric armor isn't simply combining Ebony and a Daedra Heart. If it was that simple anyone could do it.

The process by which you create Daedric Armor is fairly similar to working normal Ebony. You're shaping the Ebony so that it can serve a specific purpose. Normally that purpose is to be armor that you can wear, or a weapon with which you can harm... but occasionally someone decides that they just can't live without Ebony Silverware... or would that be Ebonyware?

Anyway, making Daedric Armor requires you to make sure that the armor you're crafting is capable of serving as a vessel for a Daedric Vestige, that's the part of the Daedroth that survives when one of its bodies are killed. Normally that Daedroth would absorb Creatia from somewhere in Oblivion so that it could reform... but you're going to interrupt that process.

You take the hunk of Ebony you've designed to both be capable of serving its purpose and holding a Daedric Vestige, then you quench it in Daedra-Blood from the Heart you're using (or water that's been combined with the blood). The Daedric Vestige notices the vessel you're offering it and decides to jump in there because reforming is the most painful experience that a Daedroth can experience. The issue is that the vessel it's hopping into is... well they have no mouth yet they must scream.

The Daedric Vestige's presence within the Ebony Armor enhances its properties. Daedric Armor is almost impossible to reforge or reshape in any way, and it absorbs impact-force like nobody's business, because the Daedroth's immortal nature is a part of the metal now. Daedric Weapons are enhanced by having an angry Daedroth's Vestige trapped inside and out for blood, therby making the weapon stronger.
